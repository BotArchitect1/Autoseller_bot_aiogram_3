## Structure and storage logic of digital goods sold

1. QR code files and configuration files must be located in the static_files folder, pre-numbered starting from one. 
There are four folders in total (two folders with photo QR codes (trial and payment), and two folders with .conf configuration files (trial and payment).

2. In case of successful payment (or trial subscription) the file is sent to the user, then it is recorded in the database (photo_id) of this file in the table "files" for the possibility of repeated sending to the user, and then deleted from the folder.

3. The configuration .conf file is identified by and corresponds to the sequence number of the QR code photo shipped. That is - if the file "34.png" for example was sent to a user, then the file "34.conf" will be assigned to this user accordingly.
The ".conf" file is also written to the database (file_id) in the "files" table, then deleted from the folder.
